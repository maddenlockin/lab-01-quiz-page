            Some corals are able to catch plankton and small fish using stinging cells on their tentacles, most corals
            obtain the majority of their energy and nutrients from photosynthetic unicellular dinoflagellates of the
            genus Symbiodinium that live within their tissues. These are commonly known as zooxanthellae and give the
            coral color. Such corals require sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, typically at depths less than 60
            metres (200 feet; 33 fathoms). Corals are major contributors to the physical structure of the coral reefs
            that develop in tropical and subtropical waters, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia.
            These corals are increasingly at risk of bleaching events where polyps expel the zooxanthellae in response
            to stress such as high water temperature or toxins.

            A set of tentacles surround a central mouth opening. Each polyp excretes an exoskeleton near the base. Over
            many generations, the colony thus creates a skeleton characteristic of the species which can measure up to
            several meters in size. Individual colonies grow by asexual reproduction of polyps. Corals also breed
            sexually by spawning: polyps of the same species release gametes simultaneously overnight, often around a
            full moon. Fertilized eggs form planulae, a mobile early form of the coral polyp which when mature settles
            to form a new colony.
